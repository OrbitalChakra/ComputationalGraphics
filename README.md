# ComputationalGraphics

I like writing code that is readable and makes logical sense. I do not want to write code that someone else wont be able to understand.
For much of this project I was relying on project requirements that I would write down into bits of code or modeled matrices to design the 3D images in this course.
In my professional pursuits I hope to use these skills from this project to learn more about computational programming i.e. mathematics, biologyj, etc.
